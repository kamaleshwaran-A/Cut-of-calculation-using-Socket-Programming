## 🎯 Cutoff Mark Calculator – Socket Programming Project
This project is a real-time cutoff mark calculator built using Python's socket programming with a graphical interface (GUI) using tkinter. It uses asynchronous communication with asyncio and websockets to handle multiple clients concurrently, allowing real-time cutoff mark calculations for various entrance exams.

## ✨ Features
🔌 Socket Communication: Utilizes websockets and asyncio for real-time client-server communication.

📐 Cutoff Calculation Logic: Computes cutoffs based on user inputs for subjects like Physics, Chemistry, and Maths/Biology.

🖥️ Interactive GUI: Built with tkinter, featuring a clean and user-friendly interface.

👥 Multi-user Support: Handles concurrent users using asynchronous architecture.

🧠 Stack Used:

tkinter – GUI interface

asyncio – Asynchronous event loop

websockets – Real-time communication

json – Data serialization and parsing

## 🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

tkinter

asyncio

websockets

json

## 💡 Use Case
Useful for coaching centers or school portals to calculate entrance exam cutoffs like Engineering, Medical, etc. across multiple systems in real-time.
